# Zombie Apocalypse ODE tutorial

This tutorial serves as an introduction to modeling a dynamical system
using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## Run these models in Binder

Click the Binder link below to open the enclosed Jupyter Notebook on Binder.
Then open one of the Jupyter Notebook files on Binder for further instructions.

## Model Versions

Two versions of the model are included: a direct ODE representation using SciPy,
and a reaction "rule-based" representation using [PySB](https://pysb.org).
